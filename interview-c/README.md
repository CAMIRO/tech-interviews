# Goals
- Determine your level of engineering experience
- Identify your areas of strength

# Instructions

> This exercise should take about 30 minutes.
- Briefly review the dataset of survey responses in `data.json` to understand the data you're working with.
- In whatever programming language you're most comfortable with, write a method that takes in the dataset and returns the total count of each response to each survey. Feel free to return the data in any way you see fit as long as we can identify which survey it is and the frequency of the responses. Here is one example of how the returned data can look:
```
  {
    13903: {
      "Yes": 2,
      "No": 4
    },
    39023: {
      "Pizza": 1,
      "Burrito": 4
    }
  }
```
