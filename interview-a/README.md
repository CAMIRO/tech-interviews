# Interview A

This is the basis for a technical interview project. This interview is suited for a senior engineer with an interest or focus on operations.

This is a client-server project in TypeScript. The frontend is React talking to a backend Express API server. The project is a simple survey tool. (This isn't TeamSense's core code â€” this is a vast simplifaction of what we can do with surveys.)

# Goals
- Determine your level of software development ability
- Identify your areas of strength

# Instructions

> This exercise should take about an hour.

- Briefly review the files in this folder to understand the code; you're not going to be asked about specifics in this codebase but knowing what's going on will help you in the following exercises.
- Review the Pull Request you were provided that adds a new feature.
    - What do you see here that is worth commenting on? What are your comments?
    - At TeamSense our practice is to ask clarifying / learning questions in a review, so feel free to do that as well.
    - Would you mark this Comment, Approve, or Request Changes? Why?
    - **Do not submit your pull request**, just share it with your interviewer (via screenshot, screen share, or notes)
- Write code for a new feature.
    - Choose one of the following exercises:
        - A quick and dirty summary of the count of responses to surveys
            - You can do this in frontend code, as a backend API, or a full-stack solution
        - Create a list of survey responses in the UI
            - This must include an interactive UI
            - You can use the existing API or create a new one
    - Choose any language you like
    - You are welcome to clone the repo and create a branch to share, but **do not open a pull request**
    - Alternately, you can create your own git repo and share it with us in the interview
- Review the log file [`sample.log`](sample.log) and note anything that looks off or that is worth investigating. This will be a topic to discuss with your interviewer.

# Developer Setup
This code base uses Node.js version 12, so install that.

# Running the Code
In one terminal start the backend server:
```
cd api
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

In another terminal start the frontend server:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Open [`http://localhost:2048`](http://localhost:2048) in your web browser to access the frontend.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Test suite
To run API server backend tests:
```
cd api
npm test
```

To run React frontent tests:
```
cd client
npm test
```

The React frontend launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
